# getting-started-with-ML

We want to show you in practice how to take your first steps with machine learning without getting drowned in theory. So we will only give you the ‘need-to-know’ of what machine learning is.

We will not explain how the algorithm works. We will not show how to choose the right algorithm for your problem. Nor will we present how to optimize the parameters of the algorithm.
